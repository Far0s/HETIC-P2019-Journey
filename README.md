### Our subject
was to create the first game of an hypothetical game design agency, while only using HTML/CSS/JS and JQuery.
We were allowed to use JQuery plugins after validation from our teacher.

### The game
is a 2D runner featuring a hero running across four lands, jumping above obstacles and dodging hostile projectiles. It is set in a fantastical land, in a colorful and nonetheless spooky world.
